# FreeIntv with Android Touchscreen Support
FreeIntv is a libretro emulation core for the Mattel Intellivision designed to be compatible with joypads from the SNES era forward even if they originally required a number pad.

**Current Version**: Enhanced with full touchscreen support for Android devices (October 24, 2025)

## BIOS
FreeIntv requires two Intellivision BIOS files to be placed in the libretro 'system' folder:

| Function | Filename* | MD5 Hash |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Executive ROM | `exec.bin`  | `62e761035cb657903761800f4437b8af` |
| Graphics ROM | `grom.bin` | `0cd5946c6473e42e8e4c2137785e427f` |

* BIOS filenames are case-sensitive

## Entertainment Computer System
FreeIntv does not currently support Entertainment Computer System (ECS) functionality. Contributions to the code are welcome!

## Controller overlays
Mattel Intellivision games were often meant to be played with game-specific cards overlaid on the numeric keypad. These overlays convey information which can be very useful in gameplay. Images of a limited selection of Intellivision titles are available at: http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/instructions.shtml

## Controls

### Traditional Gamepad Controls
* **Mini-Keypad** - allows the user to view and select keys from a small Intellivision pad in the lower corner of the display.
* **Controller Swap** - Some Intellivision games expect the left controller to be player one, others expect the right controller. This isn't a problem if you have two controllers (and don't mind juggling them) but users with only one controller or using a portable setup would be effectively locked out of some games. Controller Swap swaps the two controller interfaces so that the player does not have to physically swap controllers.

### Android Touchscreen Controls *(New)*
* **Touchscreen Keypad** - Touch any of the 12 buttons (1-9, *, 0, #) on the right side of the screen to input commands directly
* **Utility Buttons** - Quick access buttons below the game screen:
  - **Menu** - Access pause/menu (placeholder - tap to activate)
  - **Quit** - Exit game (placeholder)
  - **Swap Screen** - Toggle game/keypad positions (fully implemented)
  - **Save/Load/Screenshot** - State management buttons (placeholders)
* **Visual Feedback** - Button presses show green highlighting on keypad buttons, yellow on utility buttons
